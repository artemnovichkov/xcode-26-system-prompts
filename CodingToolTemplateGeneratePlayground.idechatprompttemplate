I need you to create a Swift Playground to demonstrate and test the following code.
**File**: {{ FilePath }}
**Lines**: {{ StartLine }}-{{ EndLine }}

{% if SelectedCode %}**Selected Code**:
```
{{ SelectedCode }}
```
{% endif %}

Please use the XcodeRead tool to read the full file context if needed, then create a complete Swift #Playground that:
- Imports necessary frameworks
- Includes or recreates the selected code
- Provides example usage demonstrating how the code works
- Includes test cases or demonstrations of different scenarios
- Has clear comments explaining what's being tested

The playground should be self-contained and runnable, helping someone understand how to use this code.

To do this, you should use the modern `#Playground { }` syntax. Insert this code at the end of the file. An example of this syntax:

```swift

struct MyFunStruct {
    let name: String
}

#Playground {
    let funStruct = MyFunStruct(name: "Hello, world!")
    print(funStruct.name)
}

```
